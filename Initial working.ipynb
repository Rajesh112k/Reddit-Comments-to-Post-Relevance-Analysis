      "- i could mention cryogonal or chimecho or carnivine or anything else but i’m going for pincurchin you see i love sea urchins out of my favorite animals they’re my fifthfavorite animals of all time for those curious 1 is bats 2 is cats 3 is spiders and 4 is sea jellies ever since i got into pokémon we’ve had bats and spiders and lots of other creatures i’ve loved it’s even introduced me to many creatures i love for example without cradily i wouldn’t have found out about crinoids until way later in life but sea urchins have always been some of my favorites and when i first got into pokémon in pearl there wasn’t one in sight gen 5 we got an ant that’s a pretty big inclusion in my eyes and we finally have another spider that even evolves from a tick which is awesome gen 6 gave us a leafy seadragon and finally a new cephalopod but still no sea urchin then we got to alola and all of the trailers had pokémon i adored we have isopods a sea cucumber a bee fly i was bracing myself for the knockout stars that would steal my heart more than any other and one day a certain pokémon card was leaked online it was a spiky undoubtedly echinodermbased blob thing with a moody face and dreary yet tropical colors i wasn’t sure at first if it was a crown of thorns sea star or a sea urchin but i loved it regardless now we know 100 it’s specifically based off of the crown of thorns sea star and its evolution takes that even further sure they’re my favorite watertype and i love everything about them sure they’re also kinda based off of helmet urchins but they weren’t a sea urchin i was beyond ecstatic with the inclusion of such a cool animal and nihilego  araquanid especially cemented gen 7’a roster as my favorite but i was still waiting for that tiny famous spiked ball to crawl into the series then gen 8 picks up and nothing about it catches my fancy britain eh the pokémon revealed weren’t my thing either except for rolycoly who was doomed to drop all of their unique traits upon evolution anyways i had also lost my copy of pokémon moon and that plus dexit had me pretty bitter about the series as a whole i wasn’t having a good year either and was only gonna buy the game out of habit but wouldn’t you know the game leaked sun and moonstyle and i saw some beautiful things namely a weird phantasm that reminded me of a carnivorous sponge that i immediately fell in love with after finding out it was a regional evolution of a bleached coral corsola form i was even more obsessed with it not a lot of the gen 8 pokémon getting revealed were my thing but this freak certainly was we were getting pokémon based off of things that had already gotten plenty of attention another dog another rabbit another monkey you name it this new coral stood out to me because of that and i thought it couldn’t ever go up from there then november 4th 2019 happened and i saw a blurry screenshot of a tiny black lump with spikes named “pincurchin” it was nothing extravagant at all pure electrictype not even part water or poison no evolutions just a cute weirdlooking face on a spiky body but it was perfect they were here it captured the simple adorable essence of a sea urchin in a way i never thought possible they even looked quite a bit like their fellow echinoderm friend pyukumuku who’s another one of my favorites they don’t have anything special about them besides electric terrain and rising voltage as a combo that or as a weird trick room team member or suicide lead with spikestoxic spikes and recover a pure electrictype in a sea of pure electrictypes with access to recover and yet pitiful defenses but they’re mine they’re adorable and they’re everything i wanted i bred a shiny one i have an actual plushie and a bootleg plushie of them and they were my favorite team member i caught her on my favorite route the only one that stood out conceptually to me as really cool the iceberg beach and named her cuddlepin catching her in a timer ball since i had waited for a decade she zingzapped through everything and unintentionally trolled my friends during a gmax corviknight raid by using lightning rod to render all their moves useless we’ve gone through the battle tower the isle of armor the crown tundra you name it i spent my one and only moon ball on an electric surge pincurchin near when the game first came out with zero regrets every time i find a pincurchin i catch them pincurchin is my beloved so yeah in short i like pincurchin a lot because i’ve wanted a sea urchin pokémon for a whole decade now we have one and they’re my favorite gen 8 pokémon if it weren’t for mow rotom they’d be my favorite electrictype no question 0.9904797001461629\n",
